Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are a category of Neural Networks that have proven very effective in areas such as image recognition and classification. ConvNets have been successful in identifying faces, objects and traffic signs apart from powering vision in robots and self driving cars. While training of robots to pick up something the way CNN is used by giving the robot a reward point when we get the expected out and if we don't get the expected output the robot is rewarded negatively. In this way a robot is trained to obtain the desired output more accurately after each iteration.
